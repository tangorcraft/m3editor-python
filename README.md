# WIP M3 Editor, python variant
Program to directly edit M3 models. This is a rewrite of [M3 Editor](https://github.com/tangorcraft/m3editor/), originally written with Lazarus/Free Pascal.

## Work-In-Progress
* This program can't edit m3 files yet, only view in read-only mode

## Requirements
* Python 3.8+ ([Get Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* PyQt5 (`pip install pyqt5`)
* Run `m3struct.py` to generate `m3.py` file
* Run `m3editor.pyw`
